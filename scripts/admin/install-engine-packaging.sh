# This is the Meteor install script, for previews of the in-progress
# Meteor 0.9.0!
#
# Are you looking at this in your web browser, and would like to install Meteor?
# Just open up your terminal and type:
#
#    curl https://install-packaging-preview.meteor.com/ | sh
#
# Although, if you aren't ready for pre-release software, try this instead:
#
#    curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
#
# Meteor currently supports:
#   - Mac: OS X 10.6 and above
#   - Linux: x86 and x86_64 systems


RELEASE="0.9.0-preview2"


# Now, on to the actual installer!

## NOTE sh NOT bash. This script should be POSIX sh only, since we don't
## know what shell the user has. Debian uses 'dash' for 'sh', for
## example.

# XXX Once this is the official script, add back in the 'exec meteor update'
#     part.
